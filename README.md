## ✅ SQL Queries Overview

### 🟢 Basic Queries
1. List all unique cities where customers are located.
2. Count the number of orders placed in 2017.
3. Find the total sales per category.
4. Calculate the percentage of orders paid in installments.
5. Count the number of customers from each state.

### 🟠 Intermediate Queries
1. Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018.
2. Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.
3. Calculate the percentage of total revenue by product category.
4. Identify the correlation between product price and product purchases.
5. Rank sellers by total revenue generated.

### 🔴 Advanced Queries
1. Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer.
2. Cumulative monthly sales for each year.
3. Year-over-year growth rate of total sales.
4. Retention rate: % of customers who purchased again within 6 months.
5. Identify top 3 customers by spending in each year.
